<p>4)The main form constructor calls InitializeComponent() method.</p>
<p>5)The main form is derived from static class Program().</p>
<p>6)this.tbSamples.Value is used to take sample values for algorithms and to generate output.</p>
<p>7)cboAlg1 is a window forms combobox(dropdown) used to select algorithms.</p>
<p>8)cboAlg2 is a window forms combobox(dropdown) used to select algorithms.</p>
<p>10) InitializeOutputFolder() moves the output screens to output folder.</p>
<p>11)this.cmdShuffle is a window form button which is used to shuffle samples.</p>
<p>12)this.cmdSort is used to sort the sort algorithms.</p>
